    <p class="card-text">Golfers visiting this 27-hole layout, originally designed by Eddie Hackett who also designed other splendid courses including Waterville, Connemara, Enniscrone and Murvagh.complex will find a scenically beautiful golf course which is always in immaculate condition. The combination of three 9's (Blue, Red and Yellow) offer different challenges but all require a high level of respect. In more recent years the Blue Nine and Red Nine have been further developed by the reknowned Golf Architect Jeff Howes, to great acclaim from Members, Visitors and Society Golfers alike  and provide a difficult but fair challenge to all levels of golfer.</p>
